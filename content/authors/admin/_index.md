The [American Society of Naturalists (ASN)](https://www.amnat.org/home.html) Graduate Council is committed to enhancing initiatives that provide valuable services to graduate students. These initiatives primarily involve planning and assisting with outreach efforts, graduate student activities at academic conferences, and ASN committees (e.g., Student Awards, Workshop, and Regional Society Liaison Committees, as well as the Executive Council). Beyond these initiatives, the ASN Graduate Council is developing an online community that supports and encourages the diversity of graduate students in the biological sciences.
